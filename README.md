# Font Changer

This is a JavaScript project that allows you to change the font of text elements on a webpage. You can use it to experiment with different fonts and see how they look on your website.

## Usage

1. Fill in one of the fonts in the [fontList.txt](./fontList.txt)
2. Execute the script

## Fonts:
[Press here to have a look at all the fonts.](./fontList.txt)
In the [fontList.txt](./fontList.txt) are at the moment Â±200 font names, I do not know if I will add more in the future.

Examples:
ðŸš§WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš§
