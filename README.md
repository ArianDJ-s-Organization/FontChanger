# Font Changer

This is a project that allows you to change the font of text elements on a webpage. You can use it to experiment with different fonts and see how they look on your website.

## Usage

1. Fill in one of the fonts in the [fontList.txt](./fontList.txt)
2. Execute the script

## Fonts:

[Press here to have a look at all the fonts.](./fontList.txt)
In the [fontList.txt](./fontList.txt) are at the moment 316 font names, I do not know if I will add more in the future.

## Diffrent versions

‚ùóBOTH OF THESE VERSIONS ARE UNIVERSAL, BUT I DEVELOPED THEM FOR DISCORD NEW FONTS, BECAUSE OF THE VIDEO OF No Text To Speech‚ùó

### Python version

The Python version works in apps/programs aswell. Thereto it's more complex. I tried to make it as open-sourced as possible, so you can read it and understand how it works.

### JavaScript version

The JavaScript version only works for sites. It's way easier.
